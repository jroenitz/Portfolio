        <p>So this is my first time EVER coding or doing anything of the sort. It has difficult to say the least but I know with the help of my TAs, professors and tutors I'll suceed in it! Before this course I was in sales at GoDaddy helping medium sized law offices getting their social media and over all online presense off the groud. I had a great time doing that but needed a new challange and scene as I enjoy marketing I figured this is my next step in my career path.

        This far in the program (week 4) I'm leaning more towards front end design, with my marketing background I think it will be the prefect fit!
